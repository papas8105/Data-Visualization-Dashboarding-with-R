#Week 2 Practice Code

#### If you have not installed the tidyverse yet, run the line below. 
#install.packages("tidyverse")

library(tidyverse)

#####RUN THIS CODE WITHOUT MODIFICATION 
###This will import the survey data we have been working with in this course and drop data with
###missing rows from the data

dat <- drop_na(read.csv("../../Data/cces.csv"))

# Problem 1

# The object "dat" created in the assignment code will import the survey data for the assignment 
# using read_csv, 
# thereby creating a tibble. Using that object as your data, use select() to create a new tibble that
# include only the columns for
# educational level, whether the respondent has an educational loan, employment status, 
# and Trump approval. Display that object. 
# Hint: consult the codebook to identify the correct column names.

#### Write your code below:

dat %>% select(educ,edloan,employ,CC18_308a)

# Problem 2

# Continuing to use the new data table you created in Problem 1, use recode() to create a new column
# named "trump_approve_disapprove" that 
# recodes the column for President Trump's job approval. A value of "1" should mean that the respondent
# either "strongly" or "somewhat"
# approves of the President, and a value of 0 should mean that the respondent either "strongly" or 
# "somewhat" DISapproves of the president.
# Display the resulting object. 


#### Write your code below:

dat %>% select(educ,edloan,employ,CC18_308a) %>%
  mutate(trump_approve_disapprove =ifelse(CC18_308a <=2,1,0))

# Problem 3

# Use summarise() to create a summary table for survey respondents who are employed full time and
# are married. The table should have the mean and median for the importance of religion column.


#### Write your code below:

dat %>% filter(employ == 1 & marstat == 1) %>% 
  summarise("Mean Importance of Religion" = mean(pew_religimp),
            "Median Importance of Religion" = median(pew_religimp))
